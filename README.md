C Compiler for Fun

This project is for educational purpose. The goal is to implement a lexer, a parser,
a code generator to MIPS assembly, runnable by SPIM.

-The LL(1) grammar of C can be found at https://github.com/CIAvash/simple-c-parser.-
Maybe C++ is a better idea?  C++11 seems to be quite productive.

Go is used as the implementation language for its ease of use, garbage collector,
and good tooling.
