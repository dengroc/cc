C Compiler for Fun

This project is for educational purpose. The goal is to implement a lexer, a parser,
a code generator to MIPS assembly, runnable by SPIM.

The LL(1) grammar of C can be found at https://github.com/CIAvash/simple-c-parser.

Go is used as the implementation language for its ease of use, garbage collector,
and good tooling.
